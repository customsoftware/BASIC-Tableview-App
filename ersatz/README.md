#  Ersatz Test

This is a simple app to interact with a REST API

The intent of the effort is to write clean, easily read code quickly and to use unit tests on the non-visual components.

Objectives:
1.  Retrieve a list of posts
2.  Select a single post and view all comments flowing from that post
3.  Write unit test for all REST functionality BEFORE writing the implementing code


In the data models being used,  posts and comments contain virtually the same data. The difference being the Comments contain the email address of the commenter.
